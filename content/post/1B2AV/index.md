## About the 1st B2AV
The **1st Argentinian Bioinformatics Summer BootCamp (1st B2AV)** was held on **February, 2024**, at the **University of Buenos Aires (UBA)**, bringing together around **50 participants** interested in bioinformatics and computational biology.

During the event, we participated in **postgraduate courses**, delivering the **introductory programming module**, aimed at providing essential computational skills for students beginning their training in bioinformatics.

UBA is one of the **top-ranked universities in Argentina**, making this bootcamp an excellent opportunity to strengthen academic training and foster collaboration within the national bioinformatics community.
