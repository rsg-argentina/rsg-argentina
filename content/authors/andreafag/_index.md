# About me 

I am a university student in my third year (between second and third year). I currently live alone and receive financial support from my parents. I am an enterprising and optimistic person, always looking on the bright side. I enjoy teamwork and making people laugh when I feel comfortable. I am a Catholic Christian with strong values and a deep love for science.
