# About me 

I am a geneticist from the Universidad Nacional del Noroeste de la Provincia de Buenos Aires (UNNOBA), Argentina. Since April 2024, I have been a FONCYT doctoral fellow. Currently, in the field of Neuroscience, my doctoral research centers on classical neurotransmission, with a focus on the differential dynamics of the metabotropic GABA receptor (GABABR) in neural regions. My work aims to characterize the GABA 𝐵 B 	​   receptor connectome in neuronal circuits under both physiological and neurodegenerative conditions.
