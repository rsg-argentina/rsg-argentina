# About me 

I’m a biology student specializing in bioinformatics/computational biology. Currently working on my thesis analyzing microbial belowground communities using a bioinformatics and ecological approach with amplicon sequencing. I have experience teaching introductory programming courses and data analysis courses with Python.  I’m excited to be part of this community to share knowledge and learn from others!
