# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio = "I hold a background in biotechnology with a strong interest in biomedical research. My experience includes working on preclinical models to assess novel therapeutic strategies. I have participated in summer research programs, such as the one at the Balseiro Institute, where I explored potential treatments against tumor cells using magnetic hyperthermia. Currently, I am delving into bioinformatics to enhance my data analysis skills and contribute to computational biology research. I am eager to collaborate with like minded peers and further develop my expertise in this dynamic field."
