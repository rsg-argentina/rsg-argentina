# About me 

I am an advanced Biotechnology student with a keen interest in Bioinformatics. I have intermediate proficiency in Python and experience with Bash scripting. My research background includes participation in computational biology projects at INFIQC, where I gained expertise in molecular dynamics simulation, analysis, and visualization using tools such as GROMACS, VMD, MDAnalysis, and XMGrace.  Currently, I am part of a research team that leverages satellite imagery and meteorological data to develop neural networks for pollutant prediction. This role has enhanced my skills in Python for data analysis and machine learning.  In addition to my technical abilities, I have served as a teaching assistant in various subjects at the Faculty of Chemical Sciences (FCQ), further solidifying my academic and collaborative skills. I have also completed introductory courses in Bioinformatics and participated in several workshops focused on molecular modeling and bioinformatics tools.  I am passionate about integrating biotechnology with computational approaches to solve complex scientific challenges and contribute to advancements in the field.
