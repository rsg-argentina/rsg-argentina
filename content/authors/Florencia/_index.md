# About me 

Hi! Nowadays I am working towards a phD at the National University of Rosario by a CONICET's  granted scholarship. The doctoral thesis project focuses on the study of the defense mechanism of Solanum tuberosum plants against potato virus X. I am also working on two other research projects in which we try to unveil and boost the defense mechanism against pathogens of interest in tobacco, soybeans and citrus plants. It has been a long path but I love what I do and I plan to continue training myself to face new challenges.
