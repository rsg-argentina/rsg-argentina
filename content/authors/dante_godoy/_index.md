# About me 

I'm a Graphic and Industrial Design student at Universidad Nacional del Noroeste de la Provincia de Buenos Aires (UNNOBA). I'm an optimistic, team-oriented person currently volunteering as Design Coordinator at RSG Argentina, where I've led the visual rebranding of the group, as well as the design of materials for social media and events like the 10th SAJIB.
