# About me 

Currently, I am a doctoral fellow at the Trypanosomatics Lab, IIB-UNSAM (National University of San Martín), where I specialize in leveraging computational tools and Python programming to analyze chemical data. My research focuses on drug repositioning, with the goal of identifying novel compounds that could offer potential treatments for Chagas disease. In addition to my work in chemogenomics, I am passionate about applying cutting-edge bioinformatics techniques to advance our understanding of neglected diseases and contribute to the discovery of new therapeutic strategies.
