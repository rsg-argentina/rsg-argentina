# About me 

I am Joaquín, a student of Biotechnology from Rosario going trough  its final year. My interest in science started when I was a kid and thankfully I have been able to develop this passion.   Last year I took the Bioinformatics course and was really impressed by the applications and the future posibilities of its implementation in each and every field of biotechnology. That is why I have been looking at opportunities to grow on this branch of my degree: from doing a research internship and presenting the results in an international conference, to applying to this volunteering oportunity.
