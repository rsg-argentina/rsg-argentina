# About me 

Since I was little, I’ve interested in Biochemist, even before fully understanding what it was about.  When I discovered Microbiology, I knew I had made the right choice.  I’m a curious person, eager to explore new ideas and applications, which led me to bioinformatics.  It was a hole new world for me, so I decided to pursue a degree in the field.  Unfortunately, I don’t have a mentor in my job to guide me, so sometimes I feel a bit lost, but I’m excited to find my path, connect with people who is working in the field, expand my knowledge and continue growing in the field.  I’m really looking forward to being part of this group!
