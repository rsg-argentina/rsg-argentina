# About me 

I am a plant biotechnology and bioinformatics engineer, passionate about data science applied to biology. My work focuses on the analysis of chloroplast genomes, using tools such as GetOrganelle, CPGAVAS, CPJSdraw, and pyGenomeViz. Additionally, I am interested in biostatistics and command-line computing in Linux.  Currently, I am completing a master's degree in bioinformatics and biostatistics, with the goal of publishing in high-impact journals and developing innovative bioinformatics platforms. I also enjoy teaching, creating educational materials in chemistry and biology, and I am motivated by the idea of bringing bioinformatics closer to schools in Chile.
