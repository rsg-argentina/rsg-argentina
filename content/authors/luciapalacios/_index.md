# About me 

I’m a biotechnology graduate from the Universidad Nacional de Córdoba (UNC) in Argentina. In April 2022, I started a CONICET Doctoral fellowship. My research focuses on Accelerated Molecular Dynamics. My goal is to contribute to a method called TAMD and study peptides and their interactions within proteins and membranes.
