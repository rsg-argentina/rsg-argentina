# About me 

Nicolás Nahuel Moreyra holds an BSc. degree in Bioinformatics from the Universidad Nacional de Entre Rios (UNER), Argentina; and a PhD in Biological Sciences from the Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina. He has been working at Instituto de Ecología, Genética y Evolución de Buenos Aires (IEGEBA, UBA - CONICET) since 2015. In April 2021, after finished the PhD, he started a CONICET Postdoctoral fellowship to address a project in collaboration with the Fundación para el Estudio de Especies Invasivas (FuEDEI). His research focuses on the study of the molecular ecology and evolutionary history of cactophilic arthropods such as drosophilids and lepidopterans. He has experience working with NGS datasets, genome/transcriptome assembly pipelines, and phylogenomic analysis. Nicolás also teaches Bioinformatics at Favaloro University and Informatics at IFTS N°7.
