# About me 

I am a Doctor in Applied Sciences, graduated from the “Universidad Nacional de Misiones” (UNaM) where I also obtained a degree in Genetics. Additionally, I am a specialist in bioinformatics and university teaching. I am a Teacher in the Molecular Biology and Genetics subject in the Biochemistry degree program at UNaM. I specialize in genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic analyses of white rot fungi and their use in bioremediation.
