# About me 

I am completing my studies at the Faculty of Engineering of the National University of Entre Ríos and working on my undergraduate thesis in collaboration with Fundación Instituto Leloir.   At university, I have had the opportunity to participate as a research fellow, attending various conferences and presenting my work through talks, posters, and papers. As I transition into the professional world, I continue to engage in scientific research and interdisciplinary projects, preparing for the next stage of my career.
