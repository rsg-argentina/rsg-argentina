# About me 

I am a biologist and PhD candidate in genomics and bioinformatics, working on comparative genome analysis using computational approaches to address evolutionary questions. I have experience in data analysis, Python programming, and university teaching, and I am interested in interdisciplinary training and science–technology–education exchange.
