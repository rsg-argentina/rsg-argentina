# About me 

I am an advanced undergraduate student of Biological Sciences at the University of Buenos Aires, specializing in Bioinformatics. I am especially interested in genomics, drug development, and the application of data analysis in the biotech and pharmaceutical industries. I am very proactive and enjoy working in teams and learning from others. I am motivated to join RSG Argentina to connect with more people in the field, expand my network, and contribute to the growth of the bioinformatics community in my country.
