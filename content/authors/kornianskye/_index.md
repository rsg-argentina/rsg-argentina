# About me 

 My name is Eden Korniansky, and I’d love to be part of RSG-Argentina. I’m a third-year bioinformatic student at UADE and currently a research intern at IQUIBICEN, working under Juan Bizotto. Our project focuses on identifying a molecular signature to improve aggressive prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment selection.  I have experience in bioinformatics and transcriptomics, and I program in R for data analysis. I’m eager to keep learning, collaborate with others, and contribute to the group. I believe RSG-Argentina is the perfect place to grow and exchange ideas with like-minded people.  Looking forward to your response!  Best, Eden Korniansky
