# About me 

I am a Biotechnology student, planning to complete my thesis in August of this year. Throughout my academic journey, I have taken bioinformatics courses, both with and without certification, and have presented computational biology and bioinformatics results at conferences. My thesis is a hybrid of experimental work and computational analysis.  I am eager to continue developing my bioinformatics skills, collaborate with a team, and learn from professionals in the field. In the future, I aim to apply for a doctoral scholarship once the country's situation stabilizes. In the meantime, I will continue acquiring knowledge and skills applicable to the industry.
