# About me 

I am a biologist with strong expertise in experimental biology and sustainable project management. I'm making a Ph.D. at the National University of La Plata, within the Plant Protein Research Center (CIPROVE). My work focuses on using antimicrobial peptides to control wheat Fusarium head blight, a strategy with significant agricultural potential to enhance crop resistance to fungal diseases. I have extensive experience in data analysis, particularly in biology and sustainability, using advanced tools such as SQL, Python, Power BI, and QlikSense for ETL process automation and data visualization. I possess a strong ability to interpret and process complex data, enabling me to make informed decisions that drive the success of research and development projects.
