# About me 

Hi! I'm Juli, a medical doctor with interest in precision psychiatry and drug development. I am passionate about interdisciplinary collaboration and leveraging bioinformatics to advance medical science. I enjoy learning how science and technology can improve healthcare, and I love being part of teams that bring different perspectives together. As a volunteer at RSG Argentina, I'm excited to contribute to the community, connect with others who share similar interests, and keep growing both personally and professionally
