# About me 

I am a Genetics Bachelor's student at the Universidad Nacional de Misiones (UNaM). I have strong foundations in bioinformatics and programming. I have taken courses in Data Science with Python, Python for Data Science, and Engineering. Among my skills, I highlight my knowledge in Python, both for functional programming, object-oriented programming, data analysis (Pandas), and Genetic Algorithms for solving stochastic or probabilistic problems. I also have experience in SQL, PowerBI, and other bioinformatics software such as Benchling and DNAsp. I am also learning Machine Learning. My languages are Spanish (Native) and English (B2)
