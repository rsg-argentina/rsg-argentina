# About me 

I work as a computational biologist.

I am interested in understanding the functional nature of macromolecules, with a special focus on their evolutionary relationships and their interactions in biological systems.

I develop and use computational tools for the analysis of biological sequences and structures.

My main focus are protein structure and intrinsic disorder, their interactions mediated by linear motifs and their evolution as modeled by substitution matrices.

--

I'm employed as Adjunct Researcher at the National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET) and as Teaching Assistant at National University of Quilmes (UNQ), in Argentina.

I'm a member of the Structural Bioinformatics Group (Department of Science and Technology, UNQ) in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

I received a Licenciate degree in Biotechnology followed by a PhD on Basic and Applied Sciences, both from UNQ.

I am currently living with my wife and son in our home town of Buenos Aires, Argentina.
