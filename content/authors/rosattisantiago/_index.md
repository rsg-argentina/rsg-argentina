# About me 

I am a recent addition to RSG, driven by a passion for exploring the intersection of molecular biology and computational analysis. During my PhD, I investigated the biogenesis of plant microRNAs, with a focus on unraveling their functional interplay with the proteins responsible for their synthesis and targeting. My work emphasized how these dynamics influence gene regulation and plant development.

While my background is rooted in experimental biology, I am eager to expand my expertise in bioinformatics. I aim to bridge wet-lab insights with computational tools—analyzing high-throughput data, modeling RNA-protein interactions, and contributing to open-source resources that advance our understanding of non-coding RNAs. I look forward to collaborating with this community to tackle challenges in genomics and beyond.
