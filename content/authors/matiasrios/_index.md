# About me 

I am a Bioinformatics student at the National University of Entre Ríos (UNER). I enjoy working with biological data, learning new computational tools, and being part of collaborative and community-driven projects. I am especially interested in connecting people, sharing knowledge, and contributing to the growth of bioinformatics in Argentina and the region.
