# About me 

My name is Alexia, I'm 24 years old, and I'm a Chemical Technician and Extraction Specialist. I'm currently pursuing a degree in Data Science. I speak three languages: native Spanish, advanced English, and basic German. I aim to combine my data and technology studies with my prior knowledge in chemistry and health. Meanwhile, it's essential for me to participate in volunteering opportunities like this one, both to continue learning and to support and introduce others to this relatively unknown field, just as others helped me get started in this area.
