# About me 

I have a BSc in Biotechnology from the University of Quilmes (UNQ) and am finishing a Master’s in Bioinformatics. My experience includes Microbiology at UNQ's Biocatalysis Lab, biosensors at Aplife Biotech, and as a bioinformatician at Garrahan Hospital. Currently, I focus on metagenomics in clinical research and protein-RNA interactions; I am driven by impactful, challenging projects.
