# About me 

I’m an advanced student in Biological Sciences, specializing in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, at the Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences (FCEN), University of Buenos Aires (UBA). Since 2023, I’ve been part of the Bioinformatics Laboratory at the Institute of Calculus [UBA – CONICET], actively contributing to several projects. Currently, my thesis focuses on the “Development of a Machine Learning Model for Predicting Ligand-Protein Interactions in Drug Discovery against Pathogens”. My daily tasks include programming, designing, and training ML models, as well as staying updated on the latest advancements in structural bioinformatics, drug discovery, computer aided drug design, and machine learning.  I am passionate about bioinformatics, and enjoy continuously learning within its diverse subdomains, especially drug discovery. Recently, my curiosity has been sparked by biocomputers and computational neuroscience.
