# About me 
I'm a Product Designer and Creative Coder with extensive experience in web development and user-centered design. My expertise spans frontend architecture, responsive implementation, and leading cross-functional teams to build intuitive digital products that solve complex problems.

My research focuses on spatial interfaces for life sciences, developing 3D visualization tools that enable researchers to interact with molecular structures and genomic data in immersive environments. My life's goal is to create interfaces at the intersection between bits and atoms, revolutionizing how people make sense of themselves and the world through technology that bridges digital and physical realms.
