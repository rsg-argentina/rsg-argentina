# About me 

I am currently a final-year student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences at FCEN, UBA. I have recently joined the Bioinformatics Laboratory at IQUIBICEN, where I plan to carry out my thesis. My primary areas of interest are genomics, deep learning, and the intersection between them. Specifically, I am focused on using deep neural networks to predict phenotypes from genotypes.  In addition to my main academic pursuits, I am also an enthusiast of the field of Artificial Life, which studies artificial systems that exhibit characteristics similar to living systems. I am eager to start teaching and connect with others who share similar interests.
