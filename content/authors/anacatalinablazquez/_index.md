# About me 

My name is Catalina Blázquez, I am a biochemist graduated from the Universidad Nacional del Sur (UNS) in Bahía Blaca, Argentina. In 2024, I completed my PhD at the Instituto Multidisciplinario de Investigación en Patologías Pediátricas (IMIPP-CONICET), located at the Hospital de Niños Ricardo Gutiérrez (CABA, Argentina). My doctoral thesis focused on the study of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome, addressing key aspects of its molecular biology and its impact on pediatric pathologies.
