# About me 

Hi, my name is Trinidad. I have a degree in biology and a PhD in Veterinary Science. I enjoy bioinformatics in all its applications. However, my favorite subfields are those related to phylogenetics, because I am passionate about searching for the origins and relationships between proteins, whether by studying their structures or their sequences. I also love using bioinformatics tools related to the study, characterization, and modification of peptides for therapeutic purposes, in order to predict their possible applications. I consider myself a biologist who has migrated from the wet lab to the dry lab.
