# About me 

My name is Joaquín Merlo, I am a Biotechnologist and Bioinformatician from Buenos Aires, Argentina. My goal as scientist is to further the understanding of biomarkers that conceal many molecular mechanisms and may be the key to achieve accurate diagnosis for advanced melanoma patients. The aim of my PhD is to study how distinct patterns of glycosylation may be involved in the modulation of the immune system, leading to response or failure to immunotherapies.
