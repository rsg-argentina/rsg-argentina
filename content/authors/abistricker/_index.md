# About me 

I hold a Licenciate degree in Biotechnology from the University of Quilmes (UNQ) and I am completing a Master’s in Bioinformatics. My experience includes working in Microbiology at UNQ’s Biocatalysis Lab, developing biosensors at Aplife Biotech, and serving as a bioinformatician at Garrahan Hospital. Currently, I focus on metagenomics in clinical research and protein–RNA interactions. I am driven by impactful and challenging projects.
