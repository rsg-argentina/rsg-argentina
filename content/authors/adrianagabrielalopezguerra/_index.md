# About me 

I hold a degree in Genetics with experience in microbiology, as well as in cellular and molecular techniques applied to scientific research. I am currently working on my doctoral thesis at the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina (UCA). In addition, I teach at the higher education level and serve as a tutor on various educational platforms.  Throughout my career, I discovered a strong passion for data analysis, which led me to develop skills in RStudio and to begin training in tools such as Python, Excel, Power BI, and SQL, among others. I am currently focused on deepening my knowledge in these technologies to enhance my professional profile.  I am excited about the potential of data science and machine learning to provide innovative solutions to complex problems. I am driven by continuous learning and professional growth, and I enjoy collaborating, sharing knowledge, and working as a team to achieve common goals and make a positive impact.
