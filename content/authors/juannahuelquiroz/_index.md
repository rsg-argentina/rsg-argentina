# About me 

Hey there! Nahuel here ðŸ˜ƒ I'm a biochemist and an advanced PhD student in the world of immunology. My relationship with bioinformatics? Letâ€™s call it complicated. But hey, I still rely on these magical algorithms to investigate single-cell data with multi-omics approaches (because who doesnâ€™t love a good data puzzle?)
