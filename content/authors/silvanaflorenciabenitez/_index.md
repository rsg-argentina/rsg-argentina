# About me 

I have a PhD in Biochemistry from the University of Buenos Aires and a degree in Genetics from the National University of Misiones. I’m currently a student in the Specialization in University Teaching at the National University of Cuyo. I’m a postdoctoral fellow at CONICET, researching the application of native fungi from the province of Misiones for the bioremediation of contaminated sites and waste revalorization from the regional industry.
