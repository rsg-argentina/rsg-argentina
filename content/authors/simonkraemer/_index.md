# About me 

I am a PhD Student at the Conservation Biology Lab at the Litoral's Applied Ecology Center (CONICET-UNNE). I am focusing on the mechanism of reproductive isolation in a group of birds, the Capuchino Seedeaters. Although, I am working in other projects using genomics as a tool to understand more about the biology of endangered birds and improve conservation efforts for endangered birds within the Ibera Wetlands.
