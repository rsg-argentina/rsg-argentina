# About me 

I am Santiago Rosatti, a scientist deeply passionate about RNA, particularly small RNAs. During my PhD, I explored how the sequence and secondary structure of Arabidopsis miRNAs influence their biogenesis and accumulation. This expertise led me to work at Kresko, a startup that harnesses RNA molecules from diverse sources for innovations in the food industry. While my primary expertise lies in wet lab research, I am eager to expand my skills in bioinformatics—a field that has always fascinated me. Joining initiatives and organizations in this area is part of my journey to deepen my understanding and broaden my horizons.
