My work focuses on genome assembly and annotation, the development of models for genomic data analysis, and the application of statistics in bioinformatics.  I am proficient in tools such as GetOrganelle, CPGAVAS, CPJSdraw, and pyGenomeViz, as well as performing command-line analyses in Linux and managing environments with Conda. Currently, I am completing a master's degree in bioinformatics and biostatistics. Additionally, I am interested in conservation and the study of the Atacama Desert, combining genomic analysis with computational tools to understand plant adaptation to extreme environments."

# About me 

I am a plant biotechnology and bioinformatics engineer, passionate about data science applied to biology. My work focuses on the analysis of chloroplast genomes, using tools such as GetOrganelle, CPGAVAS, CPJSdraw, and pyGenomeViz. Additionally, I am interested in biostatistics and command-line computing in Linux.  Currently, I am completing a master's degree in bioinformatics and biostatistics, with the goal of publishing in high-impact journals and developing innovative bioinformatics platforms. I also enjoy teaching, creating educational materials in chemistry and biology, and I am motivated by the idea of bringing bioinformatics closer to schools in Chile.
