# About me 

I hold a BSc. in Biological Sciences from the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina. In April 2021, I began a CONICET Doctoral Fellowship. My research focuses on molecular epidemiology and viral evolution from virome studies, aiming to analyze the epidemiological patterns and evolution of circulating and emerging RNA and DNA human viruses present in sewage effluent samples from the Province of Buenos Aires. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I also worked on the phylogenetic and phylodynamic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences as part of the Argentine SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (PAIS Project).
