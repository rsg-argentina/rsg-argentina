# About me 

I am a Genetics undergraduate student with a strong interest in bioinformatics, population genetics, and evolution. I have built foundational skills in molecular biology, statistics, and genetic data analysis, and I am deeply motivated by the potential of computational tools to reveal patterns of genetic variation and evolutionary change. I am driven, curious, and committed to continuous learning, and I am eager to contribute my enthusiasm and knowledge to a collaborative bioinformatics community.
