# About me 

I´m geneticist from the Universidad Nacional del Noroeste de la provincia de Buenos Aires (UNNOBA), Argentina. I´ve almost finished a master’s degree in Bioinformatics and Systems Biology (UNNOBA-UNQ). In april 2022, I started a CONICET Doctoral fellowship. My research focuses in plant-pathogen interaction in corn ear, specifically on decoding genes and metabolic pathways involved in multiple disease resistance to maize ear rots.
